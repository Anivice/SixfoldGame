Sixfold Game

1. Long Night

This deserted place enjoyed a quiet midnight. 
Dark cloud was right above that Russian-style 
two-storey building.
A blinding white light sliced the dark night open, 
illuminated the whole sky. Inside that 
ephemeral light, a ghost-like figure, shriveling, 
opened the crooked door of that building.
Behind him, the thunder suddenly growled. The 
heavy rain was approaching from far the 
distance. An ivy was unfortunately hit by the 
rain, falling from the wall. Splashing of water 
emerged from the ground, creeping towards the 
door.
?Peng-Peng-Peng?. The heavy rain hit the tile 
roof like crazy, making monotonous and 
mechanical-like noise, intending to destroy this 
old building.
Wind was coming from all directions ? broken 
windows, cracks on the door, broken roof? The 
freezing wind came with the rain sweeping the 
whole room. Old sunlight lamp, curtain, the 
door that never closes in the bathroom, books 
buried in dust and a pair of chopsticks on the 
table, all waking up from the dead silence, 
making all kinds of noise.
